### Abstract

This essay critically examines the deepening governance crisis within UK higher education, specifically addressing fiduciary opacity, epistemic injustice, opaque lobbying, and administrative entrenchment. Through detailed analysis of an exclusive gathering involving charitable trustees, political figures, and higher education elites, it demonstrates how epistemic clientelism—defined as the strategic exchange of epistemic autonomy for selective benefits—perpetuates implicit conflicts of interest and fiduciary breaches. While acknowledging nationalisation (‘un-privatisation’) as a necessary measure to curtail overt financial misconduct, the essay argues explicitly that nationalisation alone remains insufficient without complementary fiduciary-epistemic structural reforms. Consequently, it proposes an integrated reform blueprint encompassing statutory amendments to the Charities Act 2011 and the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, rigorous fiduciary transparency mandates, mandatory disclosures of conflicts and lobbying activities, codification of an Academic Hippocratic Oath, and clear structural separation of administrative and educational roles. Ultimately, the essay contends that comprehensive fiduciary-epistemic reforms are indispensable to restoring democratic accountability, epistemic integrity, and sustainable governance in UK higher education institutions.
